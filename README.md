# Text-to-speech-in-Flutter

An app that reads a PDF file an audio book in flutter
This is a simple project that i did to create a simple app in flutter that takes in a PDF file and reads it to me as an audiobook.
In this project, i used flutter for the front-end and for the Text to Speech conversion, i used the python libraries, PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 which can be called into flutter using the Chaquopy package.
